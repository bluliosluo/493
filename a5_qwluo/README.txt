I implemented the bonus part for this assignment. 

First, I added the play and pause functionality. Each search result in the 'Description' tab includes a "Play" button.
Clicking the "Play" button starts playing the preview song for that artist. Clicking the "Stop" button stops the currently playing song and reverts the button back to "Play".
Only one song can be played at a time. Starting a new song will stop the previously playing song.

Second, I inplemented the grouped track names popup page. A "Show Grouped Tracks" button is added after the 'Sort list of results by:' dropdown.
The modal can be closed by clicking the close button or outside the modal area.
